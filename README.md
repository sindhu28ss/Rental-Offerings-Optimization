## Project Overview:
This project dives deep into the dynamic Airbnb market, focusing on using advanced analytics to optimize pricing strategies, enhance guest experiences, and increase host profitability. With Airbnb's widespread influence and its complex marketplace, there is a significant need for hosts to strategically align their offerings with market demands. Through detailed data analysis and predictive modeling, this initiative equips Airbnb hosts with critical insights to optimize their pricing, predict popular room types, and uncover listing patterns, thereby enabling them to make informed decisions that improve their hosting effectiveness.

## Data Source:
The analysis is based on the [US Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/us-airbnb-open-data/code?datasetId=938452&sortBy=commentCount), which includes detailed listings data across multiple cities in the USA.

## Key Research Questions
- How can trends in the short-term rental market be analyzed effectively?
- What strategies can hosts use to establish competitive Airbnb rates?
- Which room types are most preferred according to current hosting strategies?
- What are the emerging patterns in Airbnb listings that can guide strategic decisions?
